There is an event called animationend why not use that instead of setTimeout?

@Mohammed Shafeek
Hi, I am working on a portfolio website and I want to animate a button (animation uses opacity and transform properties) when the page is loaded. After this, now if the user hovers over the button, I want a certain transition to happen (which uses the transform property). But since there is an animation given to the button in CSS, the transition is not working in :hover. To get around this issue, what I am doing is: I have added animation to a class and transition to another class and I am assigning the animation class to the button in HTML. Then in JS, inside windows.onLoad I am using setTimeout to remove the animation class and add transition class. setTimeOut will wait for the animation to complete and then remove animation class and add transition class. But the problem here is, if I decide to change the duration of animation in CSS, i will have to change the setTimeout delay in JS as well. Even though it's getting my work done, I dont thinkk this is the right method. What is the right way to do this?

You could use javascript to remove the animation class on hover. Another idea would be to add :not(:hover) to the selector of the animation class in your css to disable it while hovering. Another would be to have your button in a div, run the animation on the div and give the button the hover animation. There's also animation iteration count which you could set to 1 but I'm not sure how a hover event would effect this, it might restart after the hover. These are just some ideas though, you'll have to play around and see what works best.
